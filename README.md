# react-redux-data-visualization-example-code
This is sample code of my work using reactjs, redux, and chartjs in an event management dashboard app featuring a number of charts and other data visualization. You can see my expertise in utilizing es6 javascript, jsx, constructors, Reactjs lifecycle methods and Redux. I'm also using bootstrap with a mobile ux focus.
